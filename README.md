# Risk Game
A Risk game consists of a connected graph map representing a world map, where each node is a country and each
edge represents adjacency between countries. Two or more players can play by placing armies on countries they
own, from which they can attack adjacent countries to conquer them. The objective of the game is to conquer all
countries on the map.
